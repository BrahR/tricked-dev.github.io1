# Why do i use linux.

I use linux cause it gives much better performance than windows its better for development imo

## Customization

You can customize pretty much everything in linux from desktop to package manager to theme.

## Opensource

I really like that linux is opensource making it the perfect for people who want to tool around with the operating system.

## Distros

Theres a distro for everyone take for example archlinux its a minimal distro which is what i really like.
But theres also distro such as popOs which aim to be really user friendly and are achieving this very well,
